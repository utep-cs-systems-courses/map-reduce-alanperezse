### Intructions:
The word_frequency.py may be used as a script or as a module. The problem of
finding the target words in all the Shakespeare documents is done by running the
script.

You may run the script without passing any flags to the interpreter, such as:

    python3 word_frequency.py

If the file is used as a module, there exists only one important method, called
word_frequency(target_words, file_names). target_words must be a list of
strings that will be searched on the documents. file_names is the list of
strings representing the names of the documents to open.
